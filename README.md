# SuperMario-ASM
Assembly Language Super Mario Game 

The game supports masm615 and DOSBox-0.74-3 can be used to play the game. The graphics are slightly low end as this game was built in a tight bound time limit as a semester project.
The code is well commented and any user can use the source file to get a better grasp on assembly language concepts and how to use them to actively build a working assembly-graphics project.
